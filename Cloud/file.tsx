Q1. What is Docker and why do we use it?

  Docker is a platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into containers. 
A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable unit that includes everything needed to run the applicationâ€”code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

Q2. Why we use Docker:

Ensures consistency across environments (dev, test, production).

Simplifies deployment and scaling.

Enables isolation and resource efficiency.

Speeds up setup and collaboration.
