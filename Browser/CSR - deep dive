In **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**, the **browser is not responsible for making the HTML file** â€” rather, here's how it works:

ðŸ”¹ What Happens in CSR (Client-Side Rendering)

1. **Initial Load:**

   * The browser receives a ** HTML file** (usually just a `<div id="root"></div>` and a `<script>` tag).
   * This HTML file is **served by the server**, but it doesnâ€™t contain actual content.

2. **JavaScript Execution:**

   * The browser **downloads the JavaScript bundle** (usually generated by React, Angular, Vue, etc.).
   * That JavaScript **renders the full HTML content dynamically in the browser** using the DOM.

3. **Result:**

   * The page looks complete to the user *after* the JS runs.
   * But **search engines and crawlers** may not see content immediately unless JavaScript is executed.

### ðŸ”¸ Who "makes" the HTML in CSR?

* **The server** sends a minimal HTML file.
* **The browser + JavaScript code** build the actual page dynamically **in the client (browser)** using tools like React DOM or Vue.

---

### Example CSR Flow (React):

**HTML sent by server:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>My App</title></head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="/static/js/bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In short:
**The browser renders HTML dynamically using JavaScript.** ---> right 
 But it doesn't "make" the initial HTML file â€” that comes from the server. ---> wrong
