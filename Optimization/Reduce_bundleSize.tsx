1.Code Splitting and Lazy Loading:
Divide your application into smaller, on-demand loaded chunks using React.lazy() and Suspense. 
  This ensures that only the necessary code is loaded for the current view, reducing the initial bundle size.
  
Example using React.lazy():

        import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

        const MyLazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./MyLazyComponent'));

        function App() {
          return (
            <div>
              <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
                <MyLazyComponent />
              </Suspense>
            </div>
          );
        }

2.       Tree Shaking:
Eliminate unused code from your bundles. Modern bundlers like Webpack automatically perform tree shaking, 
  but ensuring you use named imports (e.g., import { func } from 'library') over default imports (e.g., import library from 'library') can improve its effectiveness.
                                                                                                  
3.        Minification and Compression:
Minification: Remove unnecessary characters (whitespace, comments, etc.) from your JavaScript and CSS files without altering functionality.
  Webpack's production mode automatically handles JavaScript minification with TerserPlugin
  Compression:
  Further reduce file sizes using algorithms like Gzip or Brotli. This typically occurs at the server level,
    but you can configure build-time compression using Webpack plugins (e.g., compression-webpack-plugin).

   4. Analyze and Optimize Dependencies:
Use tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to visualize your bundle's contents and identify large dependencies.
Consider using smaller, more compact alternative libraries where possible (e.g., date-fns instead of moment.js).
Import only specific functions from libraries instead of the entire library if you only need a subset of its functionality
  (e.g., import join from 'lodash/join' instead of import _ from 'lodash').
 5.                                                                           Enable Production Mode:
Ensure your build process runs in production mode (e.g., NODE_ENV=production). 
  This signals to libraries like React to exclude development-specific code and enables optimizations like minification.
By implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce your React application's bundle size, leading to
