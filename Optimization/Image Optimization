Whatâ€™s your approach to optimizing components and images?

1. Use Correct Image Formats
Use modern formats like WebP, AVIF for better compression.

Use SVGs for icons and simple graphics.

2. Lazy Load Images
Use loading="lazy" for <img> tags or libraries like react-lazyload.

<img src="example.webp" loading="lazy" alt="example" />

3. Image CDN
Use an image CDN (e.g., Cloudinary, Imgix) to serve optimized, resized images.

4. Compress Images
Compress images before uploading using tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh.
