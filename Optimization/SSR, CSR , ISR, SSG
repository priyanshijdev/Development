1.  SSR- Server Side Rendering

=> The HTML is generated on the server for each request.

=> Page is rendered on the server every time a request is made.

=> Good for SEO and when content is dynamic.

=> Slower than SSG for repeat views but ensures up-to-date data.

Example use case: News sites, user-specific dashboards.



2  CSR (Client-Side Rendering)
 The HTML is minimal and JavaScript takes over rendering on the client (browser) after page load.

KEY POINTS: 
Fast initial response but longer time to interactive.

Not ideal for SEO unless used with hydration/static content.

Good for user-specific or highly interactive apps.

Example use case: Internal tools, admin panels.



3.ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

A hybrid of SSG and SSR. Pages are pre-rendered statically, but can be updated in the background on a schedule.

Gives the speed of SSG with near real-time updates.

Great for sites with frequent updates that donâ€™t require real-time rendering.

Example use case: Blogs, e-commerce product pages.



4. SSG (Static Site Generation)
What it means: Pages are rendered at build time and served as static HTML.

Super fast.

Not suitable for real-time or user-specific content unless combined with CSR.

Example use case: Marketing pages, documentation, portfolios.
