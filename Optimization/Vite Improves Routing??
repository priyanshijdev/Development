Vite itself doesn't directly improve routing compared to React. 
However, it enhances the **development experience** of routing in a React project by offering faster builds, 
optimized hot module replacement (HMR), and better performance overall.

### Key Advantages of Vite for Routing in React:
1. **Faster Development with HMR**  
   - React Router updates are faster in Vite due to its **instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**. Changes in routes are reflected without a full reload, 
unlike CRA (Create React App), which often requires a reload.

2. **On-Demand Compilation**  
   - Vite only compiles the modules being used at a given time. This means if you're navigating between routes, only the necessary components are compiled and served.

3. **Smaller Bundles for Faster Navigation**  
   - With **code splitting** and **lazy loading**, Vite ensures that only the required route components are loaded when needed, improving navigation speed.

4. **Optimized Performance in Production**  
   - Vite uses **Rollup** for production builds, which results in better tree-shaking and smaller bundle sizes. This improves initial load times when 
navigating between routes.

5. **Native ESM Support**  
   - Vite serves files via **native ES modules (ESM)** instead of bundling everything upfront, making navigation between routes quicker during development.

### Does Vite Change How Routing Works in React?
No, routing itself is still handled by React Router or any other library you choose. Vite simply enhances the **development speed, performance, 
and efficiency** when working with routing.
