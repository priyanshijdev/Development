Code Splitting:

When we inspect in Network calls > JS -> 
consider there are :

LOGIN
1. Home
2. Contact
3. FAQs
4. Details 

when User clicks on LOGIN page then there must be possibility that all other 4 components are calling . But it's increase load time and also 
makes slow down application for hittin extra API calls.

import { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

const Login = lazy(() => import('./Login'));
const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./Dashboard'));

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Suspense>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Login />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<Dashboard />} />
      </Routes>
    </Suspense>
  </Router>
