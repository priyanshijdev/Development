Headers in REST API Calls:

Headers are additional pieces of information that are sent along with the request to the server. 
They provide metadata about the request or response, such as the content type of the request body, the authentication token, or the 
software client making the request. Headers are separate from the request body and are usually used to provide metadata about the request.

Some commonly used headers in REST API calls include:

Accept: Specifies the content type that the client expects to receive in response to the request.
Content-Type: Specifies the media type of the request body.
Authorization: Specifies the authentication token or credentials for the request.
User-Agent: Specifies the software client making the request.
Cache-Control: Specifies caching behavior for the request and response.

                                                        How to Use Headers in REST API Calls?
Let's say we're building an e-commerce platform, and we want to create a REST API endpoint for processing orders. 
The API should allow clients to submit orders, and the server should respond with the status of the order. 


Here's an example of what the request might look like, along with the headers that could be included:

POST /api/orders HTTP/1.1
Host: api.amaxon.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
X-Client-Version: 2.0.1
User-Agent: AmaxonApp/1.01
