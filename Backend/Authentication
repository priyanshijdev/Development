 Statefull: Which maintains state or data or server side.
 ex: I went to park my car in parking , guard give me ticket which contain my car no and NUM- 12. 
i.e it contains full data , state is maintained ,


Stateless: which has no state 

    PICTORIAL REPRESENTATION OF STATEFULL:

 CLIENT --->  SERVER 
 CLIENT will provide username and password in return 
server will generate UNIQUE ID (SESSION ID), 
so whenever client reqst to server it will give uid: 003  
   
    CLIENT--->AUTH MIDDLEWARE ---> ENDPOINT ROUTE
                /\
              Checks for cookie value or uid, 
              if valid then calls next() else  REJECT
