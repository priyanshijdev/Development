MOST COMMON QUESTION ASKED IN INTERVIEW OF REACT:

Q1 What is React.js?
React.js is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user
interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components
and efciently update and render them as the application state
changes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2. What are React features?
ans-
Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM to efciently update and render components.
Component-based architecture: React follows a modular
approach, where UIs are built using reusable components.
Unidirectional data ow: React follows a one-way data binding, making it easier to track and debug data changes.
JSX: React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows developers to
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3.What is state in React?
State is an object that holds data that can change over time in a React component. 
It represents the mutable part of the component and can be accessed using this.state. 
When the state changes, React re-renders the component to reect the updated data. 
like : something written in useEffect ().
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q4. What is the difference between props and state in React?

Props (short for properties) and state are both used to manage data in React components, but they have some differences:
Props are read-only and are passed from parent components to child components. They are used to pass data down the component tree.
         Props: Parent -> Child 
State is mutable and is managed internally within a component.
It is used to manage data that can change over time within a component.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q5. What is the signicance of keys in React lists?
 Ans- 
Keys in React lists are essential for helping React efficiently manage and update the DOM when rendering collections of elements.
##                                                      Improve Performance
Keys allow React to minimize the number of DOM operations by reusing elements wherever possible.
Without keys, React resorts to inefficient operations like re-rendering all elements or making incorrect assumptions about changes in the list.
 EX: items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>);
       
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q6. Explain the concept of the virtual DOM in React.
The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM maintained by React. 
IMP: It is a JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the real DOM but does not directly manipulate the browser’s DOM.
It is a representation of the UI components and their structure. 
When there are changes in the application state, React
compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM and efciently updates
only the necessary parts, resulting in better performance.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q7. How Does the Virtual DOM Work?
                                                Render the UI:
When a React component renders, the Virtual DOM creates a tree of React elements that represent the UI.
                                                State/Props Change:
When the state or props of a component change, React updates the Virtual DOM instead of directly modifying the real DOM.
                                                  Reconciliation:
React compares the updated Virtual DOM with the previous version using a process called diffing.2 V DOM are there . 
It identifies the differences between the two Virtual DOM trees.
                                                Update the Real DOM:
After identifying the changes, React updates only the parts of the real DOM that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI.
This process is highly optimized and avoids expensive operations like full DOM manipulation

       The main difference : V DOM- JS object     Real DOM- Browser Object
