Document Object Model (DOM)
=> The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a representation of the HTML structure that allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the elements on a webpage. 
Each HTML element is a node in the DOM tree
=> Web browsers utilize the DOM tree to represent and manipulate HTML documents, which enables easy identification and positioning of elements within 
the browser’s display.

However, modifying or making changes to DOM elements is a resource intensive and time-consuming process. 
When a DOM element is altered, the browser has to recalculate the element’s size and position, as well as repaint the screen.


Virtual DOM
The Virtual DOM is a JavaScript object representation of the actual DOM. 
Consider the HTML code snippet above, and below is the corresponding JavaScript object representation.

React generates the javascript object of the HTML to be precise JSX (which is nothing but a syntactic sugar to the HTML) with the help of React.createElement.

Updating a virtual DOM is much faster and efficient than the actual DOM, as updating a virtual DOM does not require 
heavy web browser processing like painting and recalibrating the space. 
It involves updating the JavaScript object directly.
