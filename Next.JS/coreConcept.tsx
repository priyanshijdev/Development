### **1. Next.js Core Concepts**

* Pages and Routing (`pages/`, `app/` if using Next.js 13+ with App Router).
* SSR (Server-Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation), ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration).
* API Routes in Next.js.
* Middleware and authentication flows.
* Optimizing performance with `Image`, `Script`, and `Link` components.
* Dynamic imports (`next/dynamic`) for performance.

### **2. Tailwind CSS + Component Libraries**

* Utility-first styling basics.
* Responsive breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).
* Dark mode support.
* Reusable components (Buttons, Modals, Cards, Forms).
* Bonus: Tailwind with Flowbite or Material UI integration.

### **3. State Management**

* Context API (must have, since they mentioned).
* When to use local state vs. global state.
* Optional: Redux Toolkit or Zustand (extra edge).

### **4. API Integration**

* Fetching data with `fetch()`, Axios, or `getServerSideProps`/`getStaticProps`.
* Error handling and loading states.
* Authentication with API (JWT/session-based).

### **5. TypeScript in Next.js**

* Typing props, components, hooks.
* Defining interfaces/types for API responses.
* Catching common TS errors in Next.js.

### **6. Performance & Optimization**

* Code-splitting, lazy loading.
* SEO best practices (`next/head`, metadata API).
* Image optimization (`next/image`).
* Avoiding hydration mismatches.

### **7. Testing & Best Practices**

* Unit testing with Jest/React Testing Library.
* Component reusability and clean folder structure.
* Git workflow (branching, PRs, commits).
