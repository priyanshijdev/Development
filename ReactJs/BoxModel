boxModel in css:
The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design and layout, describing how every element on a web page is represented as a rectangular box. It consists of the following components, starting from the innermost content to the outermost layer:

1. Content
This is the innermost part of the box where the text, images, or other content of the element is displayed.
It defines the width and height of the element.
2. Padding
The padding is the space between the content and the border of the element.
It provides breathing room around the content and is fully transparent.
Padding is affected by the padding property in CSS (e.g., padding: 10px;).
3. Border
The border wraps around the padding and content, creating a visible edge or outline around the element.
It is controlled using the border property in CSS (e.g., border: 2px solid black;).
You can customize its width, style, and color.
4. Margin
The margin is the space between the element's border and adjacent elements.
It is used to create separation between elements.
The margin is controlled using the margin property in CSS .
