How does React Router work, and what are the key components of React Router?

Answer:
React Router is a standard routing library for React that enables navigation between different views or pages within a 
single-page application (SPA) without requiring a full page reload. It helps manage the URL and renders different components based on the route.

How React Router Works?

React Router uses client-side routing, meaning it updates the UI based on the URL without sending a request to the server.
It listens for URL changes and renders the corresponding components dynamically.
It uses the History API (pushState, replaceState) to update the URL without reloading the page.
