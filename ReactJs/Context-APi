What is the Context API in React, and how can it be used for state management?
Answer :
Prop Drilling :
Managing state has always been a critical aspect of making web applications with React. 
The most basic way to do this is prop drilling. In prop drilling, you pass props around from the parent component to other components that need it,
no matter how deeply nested they are.

The problem with prop drilling is that, as the application grows in complexity, passing data through multiple levels of components can become messy,
cumbersome, and error-prone.
like : Parent -> ChildA -> CHildB -> ChildC

Q How Does the Context API Work?
The Context API provides a means to share values like state, functions, or any data across the component tree without passing props down manually at every level. 
This is particularly useful for global data that many components need to access.

mainly to overcome problem of  prop drilling
