1. How does React's virtual DOM work, and why is it beneficial?

The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements. Instead of interacting directly with the real DOM, which can be slow and costly in terms of performance, React creates a virtual representation of the UI components. This virtual representation is a lightweight JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the real DOM.

2 state and props changes
3. comparison using diffing algo
4 reconcilliation process
5. update real DOM

Step 1 – Initial Rendering: when the app starts, the entire UI is represented as a Virtual DOM. 
React elements are created and rendered into the virtual structure.

Step 2 – State and Props Changes: as the states and props change in the app,
React re-renders the affected components in the virtual DOM. These changes do not immediately impact the real DOM.

Step 3 – Comparison Using Diff Algorithm: React then uses a diffing algorithm to compare the current version of the 
Virtual DOM with the previous version. This process identifies the differences (or "diffs") between the two versions.

Step 4 – Reconciliation Process: based on the differences identified, 
React determines the most efficient way to update the real DOM. Only the parts of the real DOM that need to be updated are changed, 
rather than re-rendering the entire UI. This selective updating is quick and performant.
