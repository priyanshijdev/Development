 Webpack is a static module bundler.

Webpack is a powerful module bundler for JavaScript applications. 
It is primarily used to bundle JavaScript files, but it can also bundle other assets like CSS, images, HTML, and even fonts. 
Webpack is an essential tool in modern web development, especially for complex applications, 
as it helps optimize the performance of your site by reducing the number of requests and optimizing file sizes.

Key Features of Webpack:
                                                              Bundling:

Webpack takes multiple JavaScript files (and other assets) and bundles them into one or more optimized files (called bundles) for the browser. 
This helps reduce the number of HTTP requests needed to load a page.
