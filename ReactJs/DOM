 How Does DOM Rednering Happens in Browser?

DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard. It is a platform and language independent interface standard that allows programs and 
scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.

When a web page loads, the browser builds the page’s DOM tree. In this way, we can change all HTML properties on the page, 
remove existing HTML elements and attributes, add new HTML elements and attributes, or change all CSS styles on the page with scripting languages ​​such as JS.

What is the DOM Tree?
A DOM tree is a type of tree whose nodes represent the content of the HTML and XML document. 
Every HTML or XML document has a unique DOM tree representation. For example, let’s examine the following code:

What is DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. 
It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects, where each HTML element is a node. 
JavaScript can interact with the DOM to dynamically update content, styles, and structure.

                                                               Manipulating the DOM using JavaScript

JavaScript provides several ways to manipulate the DOM:
1. Selecting Elements
To modify the DOM, you first need to select elements. Some common methods are:

// Select by ID
const elementById = document.getElementById("myElement");

 2. Modifying Content
You can change the text or HTML inside an element:

const element = document.getElementById("myElement");

// Change text content
element.textContent = "New Text Content";

// Change inner HTML
element.innerHTML = "<strong>Bold Text</strong>";

3 changing styles 
4. adding and remove class
element.classList.add("new-class");

5. Creating and Inserting Elements
const newElement = document.createElement("p");
newElement.textContent = "This is a new paragraph";
