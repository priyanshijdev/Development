Event delegation :
Instead of attaching an event listener to each child element, we attach it to their common parent and use event.target to check which child element triggered the event. 

Q Why Use Event Delegation?

Performance Optimization – Avoids attaching multiple event listeners to multiple child elements.
Handles Dynamic Elements – Works for elements added to the DOM later.
Cleaner Code – Reduces redundant event listeners.

Example: With Event Delegation (Efficient)

document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  if (event.target.classList.contains("btn")) {
    console.log("Button clicked:", event.target.textContent);
  }
});

-> One event listener for multiple buttons.

                                  	Use Cases
1.Click events on dynamically created elements (e.g., adding/removing list items).
2.Handling menus, dropdowns, or tab navigation efficiently.
3.Capturing form input events efficiently.

 ## 		                            		Key Points
1.Events bubble from child to parent (event.target helps identify the clicked element).
2.Use event.stopPropagation() if you want to prevent further bubbling.
3.Ideal for handling multiple child elements with similar behavior.
