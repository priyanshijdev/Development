What is Debouncing?
Debouncing is a strategy used to improve the performance of a feature by controlling the time at which a function should be executed.

Debouncing accepts a function and transforms it in to an updated (debounced) function so that the code inside the original function 
is executed after a certain period of time.

If the debounced function is called again within that period, the previous timer is reset and a new timer is 
started for this function call. The process repeats for each function call.

function debounce(func, delay) {
    return () => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            func()
        }, delay)
    }
}

                                                                    What is Throttling?

Throttling is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is called. 
Throttling transforms a function such that it can only be called once in a specific interval of time.
